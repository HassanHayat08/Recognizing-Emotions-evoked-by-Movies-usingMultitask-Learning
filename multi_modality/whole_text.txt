Imagine,-0.8031400000000001,0.43504
if you had suddenly learned that the people and the places,-0.81274,0.4629
and the moments most important to you,-0.83824,0.5368999999999999
were not gone,-0.856,0.585
but worse,-0.856,0.585
had never been,-0.86192,0.60978
What kind of hell would that be,-0.867,0.657
Administering insulin,-0.877,0.688
eight forty two AM,-0.88142,0.7009599999999999
How often,-0.938,0.928
Five times week for ten weeks,-0.938,0.928
John always spoke so fondly of being here at Princeton,-0.24898,-0.43476000000000004
And Hansen is running the department now,-0.13508,-0.5549400000000001

Theyre saying with the medication,-0.11,-0.555
and low stress environment,-0.11,-0.555
No,-0.11,-0.555

is obligation,-0.10354000000000001,-0.52834
Or guilt over wanting to leave,-0.095,-0.519
Rage against John,-0.11422,-0.49288000000000004
But,-0.146,-0.458
then look at him,-0.146,-0.458
and force myself to see the man that married,-0.146,-0.458
And he becomes that man,-0.146,-0.458
Hes transformed into someone that love,-0.14329999999999998,-0.4635
And Im transformed into someone who loves him,-0.135,-0.488
Its not all the time,-0.135,-0.488

is to frame potentially innocent man,-0.631,-0.222
What are you The fucking defender of all things white,-0.631,-0.222
Were talking about white man who shot three black men,-0.631,-0.222
And youre arguing with me that maybe were not being fair to him,-0.631,-0.222
You know what Maybe youre right Maybe Lewis did provoke this,-0.631,-0.222
And maybe he got exactly what was coming to him,-0.631,-0.222
Or maybe stoned or not,-0.631,-0.222
was enough to get him killed,-0.631,-0.222
There was no one there to see who shot first,-0.631,-0.222
Which means we could get this wrong,-0.631,-0.222
Maybe thats what happened with your brother Maybe we got it wrong,-0.631,-0.222
